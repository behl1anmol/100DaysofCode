Gondola Corp runs a ropeway between Télécabine Peak and Monocable station. A single gondola can carry up to 6 people. People visit in groups to experience the breathtaking views. Given a sequence of group sizes, write a program which prints which groups should be combined so that the gondola can be filled without splitting groups unnecessarily. Group members should remain together to the extent possible. Also, groups should be processed on a first come first serve basis. 

1 3 12 3 5 1 2 4

Expected output:
1,3
6
6
3
5 1
2 4

Possible addition #1 if the problem is too simple: 
A gondola needs to have a minimum of 4 people before the group(s) are allowed to enter a gondola. People will be queued until the minimum criteria of 4 is met. If the next group cannot be merged with the queued people due to capacity restrictions, they will go in the gondola before the queued people.

Expected output:
1,3
6
6
5
3 1 2
4

Possible addition #2: (Can be combined with addition #1 as well)
In addition to people being queued, assume that up to 3 groups can be pulled forward to fill a gondola quickly. 

So, for the same problem,

Expected output:
1,3
